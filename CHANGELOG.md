# 0.47.1

- Support for Kusama CC3 (network endpoints)
- Genesis hashes for accounts can now lookup against a range (so CC2-locked accounts will show on CC3)
- Language options have been removed from settings (these will be app-specific)
- QR display loops now have a timeout decay (slower as it loops)

# 0.46.1

- Add an example for using React Native (thanks to https://github.com/cameronfr)
- Add base documentation for getting started
- Add camera access to the setting structure

# 0.45.1

- Support for Kusama CC2
- **Breaking change** The subscription subject for `ui-keyring` does not return a pre-formatted React object anymore. This is SUI-specific, so had limited use and therefore should not even be split into a `react-keyring` component. Rather users of this functionality should construct their own options for their framework.
- Experimental support for signing via Ledger HW
- Add specific settings for the icon type to `ui-settings`
- Add Edgeware live RPC endpoints to `ui-settings`
- Adjust `react-identicon` highlights (validators)
- Add `example-{react, vue}` highlighting simple use with `ui-keyring`, `ui-settings` & `*-identicon` components

# 0.44.1

# 0.42.1

- **Breaking Change** The `@polkadot/ui-identicon` package has been renamed to `@polkadot/react-identicon`
- **Breaking change** For `@polkadot/ui-keyring` the stores are now not exported from the index, imports should be changed to either `ui-keyring/stores` or explicitly to `ui-keyring/stores/Extension`
- Support for Kusama with endpoints and settings
- The `@polkadot/reactnative-identicon` package has been added (only Polkadot support atm)
- The `@polkadot/react-qr` package has been added to display/scan QR codes
- `@polkadot/ui-settings` has UNfrastructure added as an RPC provider for Alex
- `@polkadot/ui-settings` exposes a dropdown with address prefix options

# 0.41.1

- Adapt interface to cater for new `@polkadot/keyring`, where pairs -
  - expose `address` getter instead of `address()`
  - expose `publicKey` getter instead of `publicKey()`
  - expose `meta` getter instead of `getMeta()`
- The functions `getAccount` `getAddress` `getContract` in `@polkadot/ui-keyring` now return either undefined or an object with the above properties.
- Add support for the saving of contracts to the keyring
- Use the injection of stores, providing an additional `ExtensionStore` for saving to Chrome/FF extensions (in addition to the standard localStorage saving)
- Remove previously deprecated kering functions, `createAccount`, `createAccountExternal` & `createAccountMnemonic`
- Remove (previously deprecated), `@polkadot/ui-util`, all these functions have been incorporated in `@polkadot/util`

# 0.36.1

- Small fixes, latest @polkadot/wasm-* packages

# 0.35.1

- @polkadot/util & @polkadot/api 0.75.1

# 0.34.1

# 0.33.1

# 0.30.1

- Swap to publishing -beta.x on merge (non-breaking testing)

# 0.29.1

Swap to using a dev HDKD keyring (only available on latest substrate master, only affects nodes running with --dev, normal operation unaffected)

# 0.28.1

Default Substrate icon is Jdenticon

# 0.27.1

Replace Charred Cherry with Dried Danta, remove old decimals and token name configs

# 0.26.1

Add keyring support for sd25519 (schnorrkel)

# 0.25.1

Add `@polkadot/{keyring,util,util-crypto,types}` as peerDependencies for the various packages as used. Thie should allow less churn on this repo with version bumps, although it does add some extra effort onto the users of these libraries. (But the assumption is that they use these anyway)
